My solutions and comments for this problem are below.
-----------------------------------------------------
Hi! I am David Lu. 
I am an exchange student from DKU so the answer to the first question is 0.
My confidence in my Python programming abilities, as an integer from 0 to 3 is 2.
The Python editor I will be using is PyCharm.

-----------------------------------------------------
The highest level computer course I have taken at DKU is COMPSCI 301, it is equivalent to a 
300 level Duke COMPSCI course. 

I am taking COMSCI260 because I haven't figured out what to do in the future. Computer
Science itself is an useful tool, but I don't know where I should use it.
 
By taking this course,I hope to gain some hands-on experience in the application of
 Computer Science and explore one subject in which Computer Science can be applied in.

To achieve my goals for this class, I need to complete my problem sets and take notes in
class.
